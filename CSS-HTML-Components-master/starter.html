          The Space Race was an informal competition between the United States
          and the Soviet Union to see who could make the furthest advancements
          into space first. It involved the efforts to explore outer space with
          artificial satellites, to send man into space, and to land him on the

              On July 29, 1957, in recognition of the 1957-1958 International
              Geophysical Year, the White House announced that the U.S. intended
              to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became known as
              Project Vanguard. On July 31, the Soviets announced that they

              at 03:48 UTC from LC-26 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station as

              Lunokhod 1 (Луноход, moon walker in Russian) was the first of two
              unmanned lunar rovers landed on the Moon by the Soviet Union as
              part of its Lunokhod program. The spacecraft which carried
              Lunokhod 1 was named Luna 17. Lunokhod was the first roving

            <p>
              Luna 17 was launched on November 10, 1970 at 14:44:01 UTC. After

              launching rocket fired to place it into a trajectory towards the
              Moon (1970-11-10 at 14:54 UTC). After two course correction
              maneuvers (on November 12 and 14), it entered lunar orbit on

              the 1960s, the Space Race continued apace through the U.S. Apollo
              moon landing of 1969. Although they followed Apollo 11 with five
              more manned lunar landings, American space scientists turned to
              new arenas. Skylab was to gather data, and the Space Shuttle was
              intended to return spaceships intact from space journeys.

            <h2>Russia Launches Sputnik</h2>
            <p>
              On July 29, 1957, in recognition of the 1957-1958 International
              Geophysical Year, the White House announced that the U.S. intended
              to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became known as
              Project Vanguard. On July 31, the Soviets announced that they
              intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.
            </p>
            <p>Sputnik is regarded as the beginning of the Space Race.</p>

            <h2>The Explorer 1</h2>
            <p>
              Explorer 1 (international designation 1958 Alpha 1) was the first
              Earth satellite of the United States, launched on February 1, 1958
              at 03:48 UTC from LC-26 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station as
              part of the United States program for the International
              Geophysical Year and in response to the launch of the Soviet
              satellite Sputnik 1. It was the first spacecraft to recognize the
              Van Allen radiation belt, although Sputnik 2 detected it earlier.

            <h2>Lunokhod 1</h2>
            <p>
              Lunokhod 1 (Луноход, moon walker in Russian) was the first of two
              unmanned lunar rovers landed on the Moon by the Soviet Union as
              part of its Lunokhod program. The spacecraft which carried
              Lunokhod 1 was named Luna 17. Lunokhod was the first roving
              remote-controlled robot to land on another celestial body.
            </p>
            <p>
              Luna 17 was launched on November 10, 1970 at 14:44:01 UTC. After
              reaching earth parking orbit, the final stage of Luna 17's
              launching rocket fired to place it into a trajectory towards the
              Moon (1970-11-10 at 14:54 UTC). After two course correction
              maneuvers (on November 12 and 14), it entered lunar orbit on
              November 15, 1970 at 22:00 UTC.

            <h2>End of the Space Race</h2>
            <p>
              The 17 July 1975 rendezvous of the Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft
              traditionally marks the end of the Space Race
            </p>
            <p>
              While the Sputnik 1 launch can clearly be called the start of the
              Space Race, its end is more debatable. Most hotly contested during
              the 1960s, the Space Race continued apace through the U.S. Apollo
              moon landing of 1969. Although they followed Apollo 11 with five
              more manned lunar landings, American space scientists turned to
              new arenas. Skylab was to gather data, and the Space Shuttle was
              intended to return spaceships intact from space journeys.
